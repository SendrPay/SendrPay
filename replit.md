# Solana Pay Bot

## Overview

A production-ready Telegram bot that enables Solana blockchain payments within Telegram groups and DMs. The bot provides custodial wallet management with user private key import, supports multiple SPL tokens (SOL, USDC, BONK, JUP), and includes features like payments, tipping, bill splitting, giveaways, and escrow functionality. All transactions occur on Solana devnet via Helius RPC infrastructure.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Node.js with TypeScript using grammY (Telegram bot framework)
- **API Structure**: Express.js server handling webhooks and web routes
- **Command System**: Separate route handlers for group vs DM commands with session management
- **Processing Flow**: Commands ‚Üí Parsing ‚Üí Validation ‚Üí Blockchain interaction ‚Üí Response formatting

### Database & Storage
- **ORM**: Prisma with SQLite for development (easily switchable to PostgreSQL for production)
- **Schema**: Users, wallets, tokens, chats, transactions, escrows, and giveaways
- **Caching**: In-memory token cache to minimize database queries
- **Encryption**: AES-GCM encryption for private key storage using master key

### Blockchain Integration

- **Wallet Management**: Both custodial (server-managed keypairs) and non-custodial (Phantom wallet linking)
- **Token Support**: Native SOL and SPL tokens with configurable allowlist
- **Transaction Handling**: Direct blockchain transactions with fee calculation and escrow system

### Security Architecture

- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation using Zod schemas
- **Webhook Security**: HMAC signature verification for Helius webhooks
- **Key Management**: Encrypted private key storage with master key rotation capability
- **Idempotency**: Transaction deduplication using client intent IDs

### Authentication & Authorization
- **User Authentication**: Telegram user ID-based authentication
- **Group Authorization**: Admin-controlled bot whitelisting per group
- **Wallet Linking**: Signature-based verification for non-custodial wallets
- **Permission System**: Role-based access for group settings and admin commands

### Feature Architecture

  - Simplified Express server to only handle health checks, Telegram webhooks, and Helius webhooks
  - Bot now operates purely as a Telegram-only service without any web interface
  - Reduced dependencies and simplified codebase for better maintainability
- **Critical Payment System Fix**: Resolved service fee collection failure (August 9, 2025)
  - Fixed "insufficient funds for rent" error that prevented all payment transactions
  - Root cause: Admin service fee wallet had 0 SOL balance, couldn't receive transfers due to rent exemption requirements
  - Solution: Automatic admin wallet funding system that ensures rent exemption minimum (0.00089088 SOL)
  - Enhanced balance calculation to include potential admin wallet funding in total required amount
  - Added automatic recipient wallet funding for new users (0 balance wallets)
